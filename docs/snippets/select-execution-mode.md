!!! info "Select Execution Mode"

    Please choose a way to run this demo. When you have chosen, leave the selection toggled as this ensure the correct instructions are given throughout this tutorial.

    === "Run in Cloud"

        This is the easiest option. A new tab will open in your browser and everything necessary will be pre-installed.

        This option uses GitHub Codespaces and is usually free (GitHub provides credits each month).

    === "Run Locally"
        Use this option if you want to run this demo on your own machine.
